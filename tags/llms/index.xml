      <description>introduction LLM has show great success in many NLP tasks, including question answering, text generation, and so on. However, LLMs are still far from human-level intelligence. However, the accuaracy, consistency and explainability of LLMs block the application of LLMs in many real-world scenarios. To address these problems, researchers have proposed many methods to improve the mentioned abilities of LLMs. One of the most promising methods is to combine LLMs with knowledge graphs, which is a high-quality structured knowledge source with reasonable explainability.</description>

      <description>Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular and accessible to people without technical expertise. This has brought about a significant change not only in the AI industry but also in other fields of work. However, faced with so many different LLMs, how do we choose the proper one to maximize their help to our work and life? For example, when we want to polish an article, should we open a ChatGPT dialog box, or should we transfer it to Notion for processing by Notion AI?</description>
