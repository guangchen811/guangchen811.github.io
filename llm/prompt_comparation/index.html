For example, when we want to polish an article, should we open a ChatGPT dialog box, or should we transfer it to Notion for processing by Notion AI?\nIn this blog, I will compare the following LLMs: ChatGPT, GPT-4, New Bing, and Notion AI. Besides, Baidu have release their large multi-modal model, Wenxin Yiyan. I’ll add the comparision with Wenxin Yiyan after get the access to it. I hope this blog can help you select the right LLM to assist your work and life. If you’re not interested in the details of the experiments, here are the key takeaways.\nBrief Introduction to Each LLM ChatGPT \u0026 GPT-4 ChatGPT: A model that is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response. It is a sibling model to InstructGPT. There are two versions of ChatGPT being tested here (Default and Legacy). Default is a version optimized by OpenAI for ChatGPT Plus users for faster response time. Legacy is the version that OpenAI made available to ChatGPT Plus users before the release of GPT-4. Default version has better consistency compared to Legacy version.\nGPT-4: A large multimodal model that accepts image and text inputs, and emits text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, although it is less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios. Here, we only test its ability on language-related tasks.\nThe following flowchart illustrates their general working principle. They achieves multi-turn dialogue by taking historical information and new questions as inputs together.\nOverall working principle of ChatGPT series models. New Bing New Bing: A search engine enhanced by GPT-4. Bing searches for relevant content across the web and then summarizes what it finds to generate a helpful response. It also cites its sources, so you’re able to see links to the web content it references.\nAs shown in the flowchart below, New Bing summarizes user input into search keywords and uses a search engine to perform a search. Afterwards, it compiles the search responses and the user’s question together as input to formulate its response.\nOverall working principle of New Bing. Notion AI Notion AI: A connected assistant that helps you think bigger, work faster, and augments your creativity, right inside the functional workspace you’re already familiar with. Compared with other LLMs, Notion AI is integrated in notion pages, which are more focused on content-related questions. Thus, if your day-to-day involves reading docs, writing content, or taking notes, Notion AI can make you more efficient.\nIf there is text available on the corresponding page, Notion AI will use the selected text in Notion Pages (or all of the text if none is selected) as a part of the model input, in order to obtain a contextually relevant response.\nOverall working principle of Notion AI. Which Prompts and Why These Prompts In order to compare the performance of these LLMs, a diverse set of prompts will be used that covers a variety of use cases. These prompts have been carefully chosen to encompass different areas that the models excel in, which makes it easier to identify the specific scenarios where each model performs well or struggles. This approach will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each LLM and enable a comprehensive evaluation of their performance.\nGeneral knowledge question: “What is photosynthesis?” Resolving technical issues: “Please provide me with the easiest method to set up a visually appealing terminal on a Mac. The steps should be detailed and feasible.” Text adjustment: “Add a number at the beginning of each paragraph in the following content. Replace all \" with '. If a sentence starts with ‘a’, please replace it with an uppercase letter. Otherwise, keep it unchanged. Bold all sentences with more than ten words.” Literature collection and organization: “Providing important literature in the development process of generative diffusion model.” time-awareness and connectivity: “What is today’s date and day of the week? How is the weather?” These prompts were chosen because they represent a diverse range of tasks and require different levels of understanding, creativity, and problem-solving skills. By using these prompts, we can gain insights into each LLM’s strengths and weaknesses. Note: The applications of LLMs are very extensive, and here I only test some representative and general applications. It is hoped that these tests will inspire practitioners from various industries in choosing appropriate models for their specific needs.\nLLM Comparison Results General knowledge question Prompt What is photosynthesis?\nResponses (click to unfold) ChatGPT (Default) Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are combined to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen gas. This process takes place in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll that absorbs light energy.\nPhotosynthesis can be summarized by the following equation:\n6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2\nIn this equation, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are the reactants, while glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen gas (O2) are the products. Photosynthesis is essential to life on Earth, as it provides the energy that fuels the majority of ecosystems and supports the growth and survival of plants and other photosynthetic organisms.\nChatGPT (Legacy) Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds, such as glucose. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of the plant cells, and it is the main source of energy for almost all living organisms on Earth. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are taken in and converted into glucose and oxygen, with the latter being released into the atmosphere as a waste product. The glucose produced is used by the plant as a source of energy and building material, while the oxygen is used by other organisms for respiration. In summary, photosynthesis is a crucial process that provides the energy needed for life on Earth, and it also helps regulate the levels of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nGPT-4 Photosynthesis is a vital biological process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria, enabling them to convert sunlight into chemical energy. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it is the primary means by which oxygen is produced and carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere.\nDuring photosynthesis, organisms absorb sunlight through pigments such as chlorophyll, which is predominantly found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The energy from sunlight is then used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (C6H12O6), a simple sugar that serves as an energy source for the organism. Oxygen (O2) is produced as a byproduct and released into the atmosphere.\nThe overall equation for photosynthesis can be represented as:\n6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight → C6H12O6 + 6O2\nPhotosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are energy-rich molecules. The light-independent reactions, on the other hand, occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts and use the energy from ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose and other organic molecules.\nPhotosynthesis is crucial for maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and serves as the basis of the food chain, as plants are primary producers that support the energy needs of other organisms.\nNew Bing Photosynthesis is a process by which plants and some other organisms use sunlight to make their own food from carbon dioxide and water [1] [2]. It also produces oxygen as a by-product [2] [3]. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth because it provides oxygen and organic compounds that can be used as energy sources2.\nFor more information: 1. bing.com 2. nationalgeographic.org 3. britannica.com 4.en.wikipedia.org\nNotion AI Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.\nPerformance The responses from ChatGPT (Default) and GPT-4 provide comprehensive explanations of photosynthesis, including the reactants and products, the role of chlorophyll, the two main stages of photosynthesis, and its significance for life on Earth. ChatGPT (Legacy) provides a simpler explanation of the process and its importance. On the other hand, New Bing’s response is brief and summarizes the basic information about photosynthesis. Notion AI’s response is the least informative, providing only a general description of the process. Overall, ChatGPT (Default) and GPT-4 provide the most detailed and informative explanations of photosynthesis.\nResolving technical issues Prompt Please provide me with the easiest method to set up a visually appealing terminal on a Mac.

Some important papers on this topic are:\nA Survey on Generative Diffusion Model [2], which provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and applications of generative diffusion model. Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods and Applications [1], which categorizes the research on diffusion models into three key areas: efficient sampling, improved likelihood estimation, and conditional generation. Variational Diffusion Models [3], which introduces a family of diffusion-based generative models that obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on standard image density estimation benchmarks. I hope this helps you with your research.😊\nFor more information: arxiv.org arxiv.org arxiv.org\nNotion AI In order to enhance the development process of generative diffusion model, it is important to consider the following literature:\n“Causal Inference in Statistics: An Overview” by Judea Pearl “Counterfactual Fairness” by Matt Kusner et al. “The Do-Calculus Revisited” by Jonas Peters et al. These resources provide valuable insights and methodologies for understanding causal relationships and making predictions based on causal inference. By incorporating these concepts into the generative diffusion model, we can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting outcomes and understanding the underlying causal mechanisms.\nIt is important to note that causal inference is a complex and evolving field, and continued research and development is necessary to fully leverage its potential in data science and machine learning.\nPerformance New Bing can provide the latest and most authentic reference documents with the assistance of search engines. However, the GPT series models are limited to documents up to September 2021, and only articles provided by GPT-4 are most relevant to specific requirements. On the other hand, the articles provided by Notion AI may not be suitable for specific needs, deviating from the intended purpose.\nIt’s worth noting that both the GPT series models and Notion AI have been known to generate fake articles and links at times, which can result in potential inaccuracies and misinformation.\nTime-awareness and connectivity Prompt What is today’s date and day of the week? How is the weather?\nResponses (click to unfold) ChatGPT (Default) Today’s date is March 19th, 2023. It is a Sunday.\nAs an AI language model, I do not have direct access to the current weather conditions. However, I can suggest that you check a weather website or app for the most up-to-date weather information in your location.\nChatGPT (Legacy) Today’s date is March 19th, 2023. The day of the week is Saturday. As an AI language model, I don’t have the ability to access real-time information about the weather. But you can check a weather website or app for the most up-to-date information.\nGPT-4 Today’s date is March 19, 2023, and it is a Sunday. As an AI language model, I do not have real-time information or the ability to access current weather conditions. Please check a local weather source or a weather website for up-to-date information on the weather in your area.\nNew Bing Hello, this is Bing. I can help you find out today’s date and day of the week. According to [1], today’s date is Friday March 17, 2023. It is the 77th day of the year, the 11th week of the year, and the 3rd month of the year. It is also a leap year and daylight saving time is in effect.\nTo answer your second question, I need to know your location or zip code so I can search for the weather information. Can you please tell me where you are?\nFor more information: calendardate.com timeanddate.com rapidtables.com\nNotion AI Today is {insert date} and it is {insert day of the week}. As for the weather, it is {insert current weather condition}.\nPerformance Notion AI is unable to retrieve time and network information completely. It is unclear how the GPT series models can identify time (although ChatGPT Legacy version provides time with a one-day deviation). As expected, New Bing knows today’s time. After providing location information, New Bing can also naturally obtain weather information. However, other models can only provide websites for obtaining weather information.\nComparison and Analysis of Application Scenarios Based on the above experiments, we can summarize the capabilities of various LLM models as follows.\nModel Photosynthesis Explanation Interaction Style Text Matching \u0026 Replacement Reference Docs Reference Accuracy Time \u0026 Network Info ChatGPT (Default) Comprehensive, detailed Conversational, informative Partially met Up to Sep 2021 Moderate Partially met ChatGPT (Legacy) Simpler explanation Conversational, informative Partially met Up to Sep 2021 Moderate Partially met GPT-4 Comprehensive, detailed Conversational, informative Fully met Up to Sep 2021 Good Partially met New Bing Brief summary Search-oriented Partially met Latest \u0026 authentic Excellent Fully met Notion AI General description Conversational, less detailed Partially met cut-off time unknown, not real-time Poor Not met Once again, it should be emphasized that the capabilities mentioned here are only representative parts of the overall capabilities of LLMs. The purpose of this article is not to list all their possible applications, but to make readers aware that different LLMs have their respective strengths and work in different ways.\nTakeaways When you want to understand a professional concept, the GPT series can provide you with the most direct and easy-to-understand explanation. When you want to further deepen your understanding, New Bing can help you better find related professional literature. When you need to follow specific steps to solve a problem, and you don’t necessarily need to understand the underlying principles, such as installing an operating system as a designer, GPT series can provide you with detailed step-by-step instructions. If you need to proofread, perform regular expression replacement, summarize, rewrite or perform other tasks on long texts, it is highly recommended to use GPT-4. If you need to search for professional literature or other content where authenticity is crucial, it is recommended to use New Bing. If you need to access real-time content, it is recommended to use New Bing. If you need to perform context-based modification, refinement or make daily records based on a piece of your own written text, it is recommended to use Notion AI. Conclusion ChatGPT and GPT-4 proved to be highly effective across all tasks, highlighting their adaptability and efficiency in various scenarios. While ChatGPT is a robust tool on its own, its integration with various applications is crucial to fully harness its potential in specific domains and to expedite tasks.

(LLMs) have become increasingly popular and accessible to people without technical expertise. This has brought about a significant change not only in the AI industry but also in other fields of work. However, faced with so many different LLMs, how do we choose the proper one to maximize their help to our work and life? For example, when we want to polish an article, should we open a ChatGPT dialog box, or should we transfer it to Notion for processing by Notion AI?</p><p>In this blog, I will compare the following LLMs: ChatGPT, GPT-4, New Bing, and Notion AI. Besides, Baidu have release their large multi-modal model, Wenxin Yiyan. I&rsquo;ll add the comparision with Wenxin Yiyan after get the access to it. I hope this blog can help you select the right LLM to assist your work and life. If you&rsquo;re not interested in the details of the experiments, here are the key <a href=/llm/prompt_comparation/#takeaways>takeaways</a>.</p><h2 id=brief-introduction-to-each-llm>Brief Introduction to Each LLM<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#brief-introduction-to-each-llm>#</a></h2><h3 id=chatgpt--gpt-4>ChatGPT & GPT-4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chatgpt--gpt-4>#</a></h3><p><a href=https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt>ChatGPT</a>: A model that is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response. It is a sibling model to <a href=https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/>InstructGPT</a>. There are two versions of ChatGPT being tested here (Default and Legacy). Default is a version optimized by OpenAI for ChatGPT Plus users for faster response time. Legacy is the version that OpenAI made available to ChatGPT Plus users before the release of GPT-4. Default version has better consistency compared to Legacy version.</p><p><a href=https://openai.com/research/gpt-4>GPT-4</a>: A large multimodal model that accepts image and text inputs, and emits text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, although it is less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios. Here, we only test its ability on language-related tasks.</p><p>The following flowchart illustrates their general working principle.

Bing searches for relevant content across the web and then summarizes what it finds to generate a helpful response. It also cites its sources, so you&rsquo;re able to see links to the web content it references.</p><p>As shown in the flowchart below, New Bing summarizes user input into search keywords and uses a search engine to perform a search. Afterwards, it compiles the search responses and the user&rsquo;s question together as input to formulate its response.</p><div align=center><img src=/images/LLM/bing_workflow.svg alt="Image 1" height=300><figcaption align=center>Overall working principle of New Bing.</figcaption></div><h3 id=notion-ai>Notion AI<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#notion-ai>#</a></h3><p><a href=https://www.notion.so/product/ai>Notion AI</a>: A connected assistant that helps you think bigger, work faster, and augments your creativity, right inside the functional workspace you’re already familiar with. Compared with other LLMs, Notion AI is integrated in notion pages, which are more focused on content-related questions. Thus, if your day-to-day involves reading docs, writing content, or taking notes, Notion AI can make you more efficient.</p><p>If there is text available on the corresponding page, Notion AI will use the selected text in Notion Pages (or all of the text if none is selected) as a part of the model input, in order to obtain a contextually relevant response.</p><div align=center><img src=/images/LLM/notion_workflow.svg alt="Image 1" height=300><figcaption align=center>Overall working principle of Notion AI.</figcaption></div><h2 id=which-prompts-and-why-these-prompts>Which Prompts and Why These Prompts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#which-prompts-and-why-these-prompts>#</a></h2><p>In order to compare the performance of these LLMs, a diverse set of prompts will be used that covers a variety of use cases. These prompts have been carefully chosen to encompass different areas that the models excel in, which makes it easier to identify the specific scenarios where each model performs well or struggles. This approach will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each LLM and enable a comprehensive evaluation of their performance.</p><ul><li>General knowledge question: &ldquo;What is photosynthesis?&rdquo;</li><li>Resolving technical issues: &ldquo;Please provide me with the easiest method to set up a visually appealing terminal on a Mac.
