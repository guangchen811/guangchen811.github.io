Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular and accessible to people without technical expertise. This has brought about a significant change not only in the AI industry but also in other fields of work. It is therefore essential to conduct a comprehensive comparison of different types of LLMs.

In this blog, I will compare the following LLMs: ChatGPT, GPT4, New Bing, and Notion AI. Besides, Baidu have release their large multi-modal model, Wenxin Yiyan. I'll add the comparision with Wenxin Yiyan after get the access to it. I hope this blog can help you select the right LLM to assist your work and life. 

## Brief Introduction to Each LLM
### ChatGPT & GPT4

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt): A model that is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response. It is a sibling model to [InstructGPT](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/).
[GPT4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4): A large multimodal model that accepts image and text inputs, and emits text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, although it is less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios.

### New Bing
[New Bing](https://www.bing.com/new): A search engine enhanced by [GPT4](https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4). Bing searches for relevant content across the web and then summarizes what it finds to generate a helpful response. It also cites its sources, so you're able to see links to the web content it references.

### Notion AI
[Notion AI](https://www.notion.so/product/ai): A connected assistant that helps you think bigger, work faster, and augments your creativity, right inside the functional workspace youâ€™re already familiar with. Compared with other LLMs, Notion AI is integrated in notion pages, which are more focused on content-related questions. Thus, if your day-to-day involves reading docs, writing content, or taking notes, Notion AI can make you more efficient.
