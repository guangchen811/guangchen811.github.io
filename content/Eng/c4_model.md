Recently, I am working on a research project which requires me to build a large scale python project. It makes me really struggle to organize the project structure. As the code grows, it becomes more and more difficult to maintain the project. I have to spend a lot of time to refactor the code. I think it is time to learn some software architecture knowledge. After some research, I found the [C4 model](c4model.com) is a good choice for me. It is a simple hierarchical way to describe the software architecture. In this article, I will introduce the C4 model and how to use it to describe the software architecture.
