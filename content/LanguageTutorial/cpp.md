**c++** is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. **c++** runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This **c++** tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of **C++** for beginners to advanded software engineers.

# Why to Learn C++
**c++** is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning c++:
- c++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control interms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.
- c++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.
- C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.
- C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.
- C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.

# Hello world using C++
Just to give you a little excitement about C++ programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C++ Hello World program.

C++ is a super set of C programming with additional implementation of object-oriented concepts.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begis.
int main() {
    cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
    return 0;
}
```

## Overview
C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regraded as a **middle-level** language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.

C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

**Note**: A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time.

## Object-Oriented Programming

C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:
- Encapsulation
- Data hiding
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## standard Libraries

standard C++ consists of three important parts:
- The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.
- The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, stings, etc.
