The purpose of the plugin is to allow users to save their preferences or habits as a configuration, which they can then access and modify as needed. This configuration would include various settings related to the user's preferences, such as their preferred language learning method, their preferred type of content, and their preferred level of difficulty.

For example, I always practice english with ChatGPT. When I watch a youtube video and find some words/pharses I don't understand, I want ChatGPT show me the expliation in chinese and pronouncation in English. TO achieve this, I have to tell ChatGPT:

"""
In the following conversation, pelase show me english pronouncations and chinese meanings of the words/pharses i show you.
"""

It's really time consuming.

But what if I can save the prompt or habitat as a regular recommand. And just tell GPT. please expalin english words as the arrangment.


I hope every one can build there own template and share template with each other just like a costomized configration.


I hope the plugin can contain some test on topic like English learning. GPT can process this test results and save it as user features. This can help GPT know the level of the user and to custermize the responses.

The plugin should provide a user-friendly interface for one-time communication, indicating that the Q&A session is not intended to be treated as a historical record.
