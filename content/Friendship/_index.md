## Friendship Links

- [**Lil'Log**](https://lilianweng.github.io/)

I've always been inspired by the work of researchers and engineers in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. One such individual is Lilian Weng, whose blog has been an invaluable source of knowledge and inspiration for me. Her well-researched articles on various topics in generative models, deep learning, and reinforcement learning have been essential in my own learning journey.

In fact, I've even chosen to use **the same theme** for my blog as Lil'Log, in tribute to the impact her work has had on me. I highly recommend [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) to anyone interested in exploring language models, generative models, and other machine learning concepts.

- [**Generative Space**](https://yang-song.net/blog/)

If you are interested in generative models, especially diffusion models, I highly recommend checking out Yang Song's blog, Generative Space. Yang Song is a well-known expert in this field, and his blog contains numerous informative and insightful posts about generative models, including the score-based diffusion model. The blog is well-designed and easy to follow, making it a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about this exciting area of research.

- [**Leo's Blog**](https://leoleoasd.me)

Leo is a colleague of mine from my internship at LinkedIn China. He is currently following the latest topics in LLMs and sharing his insights on his blog. I believe it will continue to provide valuable insights in the future.
