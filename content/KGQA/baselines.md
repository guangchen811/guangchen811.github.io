# What is Knowledge graph question answering

# Main stream KGQA methods: knowledge grounding based and semantic parsing based.

I may also need to explain the different type of KGQA tasks: open-domain and closed-domain KGQA.

# explain each type of methods with one example, provide the pros and cons of each type of methods.

# How can LLM be used in these two types of methods?

You can also check my privioous blog about this topic[^1].

# For knowledge grounding based methods

# For semantic parsing based methods

# Discussion

discuss other potential applications of LLM in KGQA.

1. For dataset generation

Agrawal, Garima, Kuntal Pal, Yuli Deng, Huan Liu, and Ying-Chih Chen. “CyberQ: Generating Questions and Answers for Cybersecurity Education Using Knowledge Graph-Augmented LLMs.” Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 38, no. 21 (March 24, 2024): 23164–72. https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i21.30362.

2. Multi-turn KGQA

Xiong, Guanming, Junwei Bao, and Wen Zhao. “Interactive-KBQA: Multi-Turn Interactions for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Large Language Models.” arXiv, February 23, 2024. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15131.
